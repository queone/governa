# Agent Roles

Role-specific behavior docs that supplement the shared governance contract in `AGENTS.md`.

## How It Works

1. At session start, the agent checks whether a role has been explicitly assigned.
2. If no role is assigned and `maintainer.md` exists, the agent defaults to maintainer and announces it (e.g., "Operating as maintainer (default).").
3. If no role is assigned and no `maintainer.md` exists, the agent asks which role to assume.
4. Role assignment requires an explicit instruction: "act as DEV", "use docs/agent-roles/qa.md", or "you are QA". Assignment overrides the default.
5. The role name is case-insensitive: "DEV", "Dev", and "dev" all resolve to `dev.md`.
6. If the requested role file does not exist, the agent says so and continues under shared governance only.

## Available Roles

| File | Role | Focus |
|------|------|-------|
| `dev.md` | DEV | Content creation, editorial workflow |
| `qa.md` | QA | Editorial review, accuracy verification |
| `maintainer.md` | Maintainer | Combined creation and review for single-agent repos |

## Adding Custom Roles

Create a new `<role>.md` file in this directory. Keep it concise — role docs supplement `AGENTS.md`, they do not replace it. Each file should contain short, actionable rules that the agent follows after role assignment.
