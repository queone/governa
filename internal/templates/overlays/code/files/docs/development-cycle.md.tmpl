# Development Cycle

This repo uses an acceptance-criteria-first workflow.

## Required Artifacts

- `AGENTS.md`
- `README.md`
- `arch.md`
- `plan.md`
- `docs/`

## Cycle

1. **Choose the next approved item.** Origination is either (a) an `Ideas To Explore` entry promoted after the director rubric-clears it, or (b) director-originated work (governance, adoption, hotfix, refinement). ACs are the single execution surface — draft directly when authorized.
2. **Draft an acceptance-criteria doc.** Start from `docs/ac-template.md` (see preamble for the monotonic-numbering rule); save as `docs/ac<N>-<slug>.md`.
3. **Review and tighten scope before implementation.** When QA files findings on the AC, DEV responds in the conversation with proposed changes or explicit disagreement, but does not edit the AC file until QA replies and the director confirms the iteration is closed. Repeat until the AC is implementation-ready. See `docs/critique-protocol.md` for the full critique-round protocol (round-append structure, terminator shape, and DEV/QA cross-references).
4. **Implement code, tests, and direct doc updates together.**
5. **Capture decisions in durable docs or code when the AC is complete.** The AC file is removed during release prep (see `docs/build-release.md` Pre-Release Checklist).
6. **Run the build and validation flow.** See `docs/build-release.md`.
7. **Perform release work only when explicitly requested.**

## Notes

- keep roadmap decisions in `plan.md`
- keep architecture changes in `arch.md`
- keep repo-level governance in `AGENTS.md`
- record follow-on ideas in `plan.md` under `Ideas To Explore` with an `IE<N>:` prefix (pre-rubric idea or pointer to a drafted AC stub)
- remove IE entries when the underlying idea is closed — rejected, retired, or (for AC pointers) the pointed-to AC has shipped
- write AC docs to file (`docs/ac<N>-<slug>.md`); summarize in the response but do not dump full AC content into conversation
- promotion path: shape (a) IE → discussion → objective-fit rubric (see `AGENTS.md` Approval Boundaries) → AC drafted (IE converts to shape (b) pointer, same `IE<N>` number) → AC ships (IE removed)

## Local Rules

Repos may extend governance docs with rules specific to the project. Place these in a `## Local Rules` section at the end of the relevant supplementary governance doc (most commonly `docs/build-release.md`, but any supplementary doc may carry one). Apply does not modify `## Local Rules` sections — they are consumer-owned content.

**Not AGENTS.md.** AGENTS.md's section set is fixed by its own `## Governed Sections` invariant — adding a non-governed `## Local Rules` section there would violate the governance contract. Keep repo-specific AGENTS.md additions inside an already-governed section (e.g., append a bullet to `## Project Rules`), and reserve `## Local Rules` for supplementary docs under `docs/`.

Use Local Rules when a rule is genuinely repo-specific — it applies to this project only and doesn't warrant upstream adoption into the governa template. If a rule might benefit other consumer repos, raise it with the governa maintainers directly so they can evaluate it for the template.

The section name is exact: `## Local Rules` (title case, singular "Local" + plural "Rules"). Use this exact section name for consistency across governed repos.
